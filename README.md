# MemorizingMachine
GUI.java, TextOverlay.java, Memorizing_Goal.java, Memory_Methods.java, have most of the program in them. Some of the other files (APIAuthenticator.java, DataHandler.java) do not contribute to the functionality of this program at this time. This is a Java Application I have worked on that helps people memorize a group of text. I made it with the intention of helping students memorize Bible verses.
